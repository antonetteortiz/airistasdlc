# Airista SDLC
Airista SDLC, defining the cycle of development, all the task involved in planning, creating. testing and deploying our Software Product. 

- Customer request and enhancements will be gathered monthly.
- Development team will review the request and determine length of time needed for the implementation and testing phase.
- During the testing phase, the developed code is tested thoroughly to detect the defects in the software. Defects are logged as a subtask in the ticket and  are retested once fixed.
- In the Deployment phase, the developed code is moved into production after the sign off is given by the customer. Any issues in the production environment are resolved by the developers which come under maintenance and bug tickets will be assigned.


#Requirement Gathering and Analysis

    - During this phase development team will meet with technical service team to discuss relevant information and requirements regarding application enhancements and request made by customer.
    
    - Once requirements are gather and clearly understood, development team will begin to map out data requirements, external interface requirements and test cases. Tickets will be assigned on Jira for development and QA testing. (See documentation for ticket requirements).

#Creating Sprint
    - Requirements are broken in to sub-task and tickets are assigned.
    - Implementation/Coding starts once developers are assigned tickets. Software request and enhancements are translated into source code.
    - Development team work in sprints to complete ticket issues.
   
#Testing
    - Following each sprint, developed code will be tested throughly to detect defects if any in the software. 
    - Defects are logged, tickets are issued and retested once fixed. 
    - Bug logging and retest goes on until the updated software goes live. 
    
#Deployment
    - The developed code is released and given to customer.
    - Any issues in the production enviornment are resolved by the development team which come under maintenance.
